\makequotation{I think it's fair to say that more persons in the world know how to
write simple programs in BASIC than in any other language. It is true
that most of them are probably still unable to vote or buy a drink.  
%% And
%% if FORTRAN is the lingua franca, then certainly it must be true that
%% BASIC is the lingua playpen.
}{Thomas E. Kurtz, co-creator of BASIC, in
  1981~\cite{hopl}} 

Since in the 1970s there was no third-party PC software industry as we
now know it, the target audience for PCs was assumed to be people who
would learn to code, and BASIC was by design the simplest path.
While the term ``open source'' hadn't been invented in 1964, and BASIC's
source code itself was not ``open'' as we use that term today, its
inventors were clear that anyone was free to implement the language
without requiring a license from Dartmouth.
Indeed, there wasn't even a requirement that implementers adhere to a
spec; ``Minimal BASIC'' wasn't even standardized by the American
National Standards Institute until 1978.

\begin{tangent}{}
In contrast, modern languages are often more tightly protected.
For example, Java implementations must pass an Oracle ``compatibility
suite'' whose licensing terms impose intellectual property constraints
that restrict how you may redistribute your
implementation~\cite{apache-java-letter,apache-resigns-jcp}.
\end{tangent}

Because BASIC was unencumbered and easy to learn, it quickly became
influential not only in colleges and universities, but among PC
makers.
Indeed, as Chuck Peddle had foreseen, PC vendors soon realized that a
computer \emph{without} built-in BASIC was a competitive liability.
Sphere Computer and Processor Technology boasted low-cost computers
whose BASIC was vaporware at the time of introduction and
underperformed when finally released~\cite[p. 114, 134]{veit}; both
companies quickly went under.
When Steve Jobs demonstrated the prototype Apple~I at a
conference\footnote{Actually a dinner meeting of the New York chapter
of the Association for Computing Machinery, the first and largest
professional society for academic and professional computists.} in
1976, the technical attendees were astonished at the hardware, but
dealers' reactions amounted to ``call us when BASIC is available.''
Jobs said Woz was ``working hard'' on BASIC for the follow-on
Apple~II~\cite[pp. 92ff]{veit}, which was true---on August 26, 1976,
two nights before the first national computer show in Atlantic City,
NJ, Woz was using his hotel room's TV to finish work on Apple
``Integer BASIC'' in time for the show's opening.

\begin{tangent}
Unlike Gates, Woz knew little about interpreters or compilers, he
couldn't afford an assembler program, and his knowledge of BASIC was
based on a few hours at a high school terminal and his job at
Hewlett-Packard, which made BASIC available for its
mainframes.
\end{tangent}

\smallpicfigure{figs/breakout.jpg}{fig:breakout}{The \emph{Breakout}
  game implemented in Apple Integer BASIC.  According to Woz
  himself~\cite{woz-basic}, being able to code games like this one,
  which he had designed for Atari a few years before, was his
  main goal for Apple BASIC.}

The trend was clear: users expected to turn on their PCs and start
programming in BASIC, courtesy of a ROM-based interpreter.
And Micro-Soft was perfectly positioned to take advantage of this
trend.
Woz's Apple BASIC was markedly inferior to Micro-Soft's (reflecting
Woz's relative lack of sophistication in software design compared to
Bil Gates), and when angel investor Mike Markkula joined Apple in 1977
as the new CEO, he quickly negotiated a deal with Gates to port
Micro-Soft BASIC to the Apple~II, paying double what Commodore had
paid~\cite[p. 114]{commodore}.


That same year, Radio Shack made a deal with Gates to provide Micro-Soft
BASIC as an upgrade feature to its TRS-80 Model I, whose entry-level BASIC
was a direct descendant of the free Palo Alto Tiny BASIC, with Gates
again doubling the price that Apple had paid.
Micro-Soft BASIC was now the dominant computer language on the first
three major PCs---the Commodore PET, TRS-80 Model I, and Apple II, all
released in 1977.

%% \tablefigure{figs/basics.tex}{fig:basics}{The first crop of ``ready-to-run'' PCs
%%     all featured BASIC in ROM.  Woz's Integer BASIC was written from
%%     scratch; TRS-80 Level~I BASIC was based on Palo Alto Tiny BASIC; the
%%     rest are ports of Microsoft BASIC.}

If your computer had BASIC, as virtually all PCs did, in principle you had access
to a growing library of community-authored programs, even though it
usually required laboriously typing the programs in (since tape and
disk formats were incompatible across different computer systems).
But even though most early PC BASICs were direct descendants of the
original Micro-Soft BASIC, there were differences.
When Woz designed the original Apple BASIC, he was primarily interested in making it easy to create games,
so Apple BASIC included
commands to draw color graphics and read the position of a joystick,
but no floating-point arithmetic or file I/O.  This
pattern of incompatibly ``tweaking'' each dialect of BASIC to match
the underlying computer's hardware and the whims of its designers
would only accelerate as falling technology prices led to an explosion
in the availability of different kinds of PCs, 
since features such as graphics and sound worked differently on each
system.
The incompatibility was not the result of capriciousness: PC designers
were trying to keep prices low while providing more features to entice
buyers, and the tension between the two often required them to do
technological headstands to implement a feature cheaply enough to keep
their prices competitive.

So BASIC ultimately had to be modified differently for each computer
in order to allow programmers to exploit those different features.
Like species that gradually become distinct and unable to mate, the ``dialects'' of BASIC
soon diverged enough that small changes to
published program listings were insufficient to allow BASIC
programs to run on different platforms.
In time, over 60 different PC models implemented BASIC in ROM alone,
not counting later disk implementations such as GWBASIC for MS-DOS.

Kemeny and Kurtz, BASIC's original creators, were dismayed at this
proliferation of incompatible dialects and the addition of
\emph{ad~hoc} features that (in their opinion) were often in poor
technical taste and contrary to the original spirit and goals of the
language.
They began using the derogatory term ``street BASIC'' to distinguish
these incompatible mass-market dialects from the original language
they had been curating and using at Dartmouth.
But as university educators, they may have been even more dismayed
that the ``killer app'' for BASIC turned out to be not formal
computing education, but games.
