\makequotation{I think it's fair to say that more persons in the world know how to
write simple programs in BASIC than in any other language. It is true
that most of them are probably still unable to vote or buy a drink.  
%% And
%% if FORTRAN is the lingua franca, then certainly it must be true that
%% BASIC is the lingua playpen.
}{Thomas E. Kurtz, co-creator of BASIC, in
  1981~\cite{hopl}} 

While the term ``open source'' hadn't been invented in 1964, and BASIC's
original source code itself was not ``open'' as we use that term today, its
inventors made clear that anyone was free to \emph{implement} the language
without a license from Dartmouth.
Perhaps unfortunately, this permissiveness also meant that there was
no standard set of requirements that any particular version of BASIC
had to meet in order to call itself BASIC.


\begin{tangent}{}
In contrast, modern languages are often more tightly protected.
For example, Java implementations must pass an Oracle ``compatibility
suite'' whose licensing terms impose intellectual property constraints
that restrict how you may redistribute your
implementation~\cite{apache-java-letter,apache-resigns-jcp}.
 ``Minimal BASIC'' was standardized by the American
National Standards Institute in 1978, but by that time, many variants
of the language had already proliferated and the standard was largely ignored.
\end{tangent}

Nonetheless, precisely because BASIC was unencumbered and easy to learn, it quickly became
influential not only in colleges and universities, but among PC
makers.
Indeed, as Chuck Peddle had foreseen, PC vendors soon realized that a
computer \emph{without} BASIC built in was a competitive liability.
Sphere Computer and Processor Technology boasted low-cost computers
whose BASIC was vaporware at the time of introduction and
underperformed when finally released~\cite[p. 114, 134]{veit}; both
companies quickly went under.
When Steve Jobs demonstrated the prototype Apple~I at a
conference\footnote{Actually a dinner meeting of the New York chapter
of the Association for Computing Machinery, the first and largest
professional society for computing professionals.} in
1976, the technical attendees were astonished at the hardware, but
dealers' reactions amounted to ``call us when BASIC is available.''
Jobs said Woz was ``working hard'' on BASIC for the follow-on
Apple~II~\cite[pp. 92ff]{veit}, which was true---on August 26, 1976,
two nights before the first national computer show in Atlantic City,
not far from New York, Woz was using the TV in  his hotel room as a
monitor,  finishing work on Apple
``Integer BASIC'' in time to demonstrate it at the show.

\begin{tangent}
Unlike Gates, Woz knew little about interpreters or compilers, he
couldn't afford an assembler program, and his knowledge of BASIC was
based on a few hours at a high school terminal and his job at
Hewlett-Packard, whose mainframe computers had BASIC on them.
Woz was primarily interested in writing games, so his Apple BASIC
included commands to draw color graphics and read the position of a
joystick, but no floating-point arithmetic or file I/O.
\end{tangent}

\smallpicfigure{figs/breakout.jpg}{fig:breakout}{The \emph{Breakout}
  game implemented in Apple Integer BASIC.  According to Woz
  himself~\cite{woz-basic}, being able to easily create games like this one,
  which he had designed for Atari a few years before, was his
  main goal for Apple BASIC.}

The trend was clear: users expected to turn on their PCs and start
programming in BASIC, courtesy of a ROM-based interpreter.
And Micro-Soft was perfectly positioned to take advantage of this
trend.
Unlike Gates the software wizard, Woz was really a hardware specialist, so
his Apple BASIC was inferior to Micro-Soft's.
When investor Mike Markkula joined Apple in 1977
as the new CEO, he quickly negotiated a deal with Gates to port
Micro-Soft BASIC to the Apple~II, paying double what Commodore had
paid~\cite[p. 114]{commodore}.
That same year, Radio Shack made a deal to provide Micro-Soft
BASIC as an upgrade for the TRS-80 Model~I, which shipped with 
the free Palo Alto Tiny BASIC,
again doubling the price that Apple had paid.
Micro-Soft BASIC was now the dominant computer language on the first
three major PCs---the Commodore PET, TRS-80 Model~I, and Apple~II, all
released in 1977.

%% \tablefigure{figs/basics.tex}{fig:basics}{The first crop of ``ready-to-run'' PCs
%%     all featured BASIC in ROM.  Woz's Integer BASIC was written from
%%     scratch; TRS-80 Level~I BASIC was based on Palo Alto Tiny BASIC; the
%%     rest are ports of Microsoft BASIC.}

Although cassettes were widely used by hobbyists as a way to store
programs inexpensively, and floppy disk drives were slowly beginning
to appear, cassette and disk formats were incompatible across
different computer systems.
Cassettes or disks created for a TRS-80 wouldn't work on an Apple or
Commodore, just as today's PC programs don't work on Macs.
So hobbyists had to laboriously type in programs from printed listings
in hobbyist magazines.
Those programs were usually written in Micro-Soft BASIC
(by then the \emph{de~facto} standard),  but as new computers entered
the market and introduced
innovative hardware features such as
graphics and sound, each manufacturer modified their version of 
Micro-Soft BASIC to take advantage of their computers' newest features.
In time, over 60 different PC models implemented BASIC in ROM alone,
not counting later disk implementations such as GWBASIC for MS-DOS.
Like species that gradually become distinct and unable to mate, these
different ``dialects'' of BASIC soon diverged enough that all but the
simplest BASIC programs became vendor-specific, increasing the market
for hobbyist magazines focused on one particular type of computer.

Kemeny and Kurtz, BASIC's original creators, were dismayed at this
proliferation of incompatible dialects and the addition of
\emph{ad~hoc} features that (in their opinion) were often in poor
technical taste and contrary to the original spirit and goals of the
language.
They began using the derogatory term ``street BASIC'' to distinguish
these incompatible mass-market dialects from the original language
they had been curating and using at Dartmouth.
But as university educators, they may have been even more dismayed
that the ``killer app'' for BASIC turned out to be not formal
computing education as they had intended, but\ldots{}games.
