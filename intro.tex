Much has been written over the decades about the democratization of
computers thanks to Moore's Law, but what has been overlooked is that up
until the consumer Internet appeared in around 1995, BASIC was present
at every milestone, and played a pivotal role in empowering generations
of programmers.
Yet BASIC is probably one of the most maligned programming languages
to achieve widespread use.

In \emph{Back to BASIC}~\cite{backtobasic}, the language's co-creators
object that the criticisms leveled at the 
BASIC dialects that proliferated after BASIC became the
\emph{lingua franca} of PCs did not apply to the original language
they had created and to its designated descendants.
This defense seems doubtful, since the original language did include
\T{GO~TO}, which Dijkstra famously railed
against~\cite{goto_considered_harmful}.

Nonetheless, even if we grant the criticisms,
they miss the goal of the
language, which was to expose as many non-programmers as possible to
programming---something it accomplished beyond its creators' wildest dreams,
if not in the precise way they had envisioned.
BASIC introduced an entire generation of
programmers to programming.  If it inculcated ``bad'' habits that
structured languages tried to break,  it also taught us computational
thinking.    It's time the true story of BASIC's influence was told.
