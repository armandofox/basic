\makequotation{The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should,
  therefore, be regarded as a
  criminal offence.}{Edsger W. Dijkstra}

\makequotation{I think it's fair to say that more persons in the world know how to
write simple programs in BASIC than in any other language. It is true
that most of them are probably still unable to vote or buy a drink.  And
if FORTRAN is the lingua franca, then certainly it must be true that
BASIC is the lingua playpen.}{Thomas E. Kurtz, co-creator of BASIC, in
  1981~\cite{hopl}} 

\makequotation{If FORTRAN has been called an infantile disorder, PL/I
  must be classified as a fatal disease.}{Edsger W. Dijkstra}

\makequotation{In a sense the electronic industry has not solved a
  single problem; it has only created them---it has created the problem
  of using its products\ldots and it was the poor programmer who found
  his job in this exploded field of tension between ends and
  means.}{Edsger W. Dijkstra}
