Theme: democratizing force.  Whenever there was a tech milestone with
the *potential* to further democratize computing, BASIC was right there
with it, co-leading the charge.  BASIC has been in on the ground floor
of (at least) three "computing for everyone" or "democratizing
computing" ecosystems.  The WWW was the first one that *didn't* feature
BASIC prominently.


from \cite[p. 114, 134]{veit}:

(Vendors began to realize that BASIC was no longer a differntiator but a
competitive necessity.)  Sphere Computer and Processor Technology
boasted low-cost computers that included BASIC, but the BASIC was
vaporware at the time of introduction.  Processor Technology 
contracted their BASIC out to NorthStar, which also licensed it to
others and ultimately undersold PT with its own computer,
and Sphere's BASIC underperformed when finally
released.  Both companies quickly went under.



The 6502 has had pop culture appearances in Futurama

) and The Terminator (screenshot in Wikipedia article on 6502; looks
like it's recognizably from one of the example programs in the Apple
ProDOS Technical Reference Manual!)

Applesoft BASIC helped Microsoft through a shaky financial time
