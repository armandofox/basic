\makequotation{Whether we're still programming in it or not, the spirit
  of BASIC lives on in all of us.}{Jeff Atwood, founder of
  StackExchange and author of Coding Horror blog~\cite{codinghorror_basic}}

BASIC's role in the 1980s is analogous to JavaScript's role in the
1990s: its performance and relative isolation from the hardware limited
the kinds of programs you could write, but your programs could have a
huge audience.
With no economical mass storage (floppy disks) coming until 1980 (verify!), and no
consumer-facing Internet until the 1990s, BASIC programs were
distributed by a far more prosaic medium: magazines published source
code listings that users would laboriously type in.
One of the granddaddies of type-in BASIC games traces its origins to
1971, when Mike Mayfield and some high school friends used an SDS Sigma
7 computer to write a single-player game inspired by the original Star
Trek TV series, which had just ended its 3-season run and was very
popular.

In the game, the player commands the USS Enterprise and moves it around
a grid seeking and destroying Klingon warships.
Mayfield later ported the game to Hewlett-Packard BASIC in exchange for
some time on an HP-2000C timesharing computer at a local HP sales
office.
The HP version was found by David Ahl of DEC's education department, and
in the share-alike mentality of the day, he immediately ported it to DEC
BASIC and shared it freely via the DEC Education
Newsletter, encouraging readers to submit their own games.

In 1978 Ahl launched \emph{Creative Computing}, one of the first
magazines focused on emerging microcomputers and featuring lots of
so-called ``type-in programs.''
Ahl ported his original collection of games (including an improved
\emph{Super Star Trek}) to Microsoft BASIC, which had emerged as the
\emph{de~facto} standard microcomputer BASIC, and republished the result
as \emph{BASIC Computer Games}~\cite{basic_computer_games}, the first
computer book to sell over a million copies.\footnote{You can play a
  JavaScript port of the original game at \url{http://www.arctuviangambit.com/startrek.html}}

Younger readers may be surprised to learn how many pioneering games were
written in BASIC and relied on line-at-a-time text output, but
surprisingly sophisticated games were created this way.
Scott Adams wrote interactive text adventure games in BASIC, and started
the first software company devoted exclusively to game publishing,
Adventure International.\footnote{The earliest interactive text adventure (you type
``Go North''; the computer types back something like ``You are next to a
running stream'') had been written by Will Crowther in FORTRAN.}
Adams even published a complete game called \emph{Pirate's Adventure} as
a type-in program in a special issue of BYTE devoted to adventure
games~\cite{byte80:adventure}; the article helpfully notes which parts
of the BASIC program would have to be changed to run on other
Microsoft-derived BASIC dialects.
\emph{Oregon Trail}, a turn-based simulation based on the US westward
migration, was written in 1971 by Don Rawitsch, a college senior who was
a teaching assistant for a US~history course, with the help of
fellow student teachers Bill Heinemann and Paul Dillenberger.

Falling hardware prices soon enabled PCs with crude graphics.
Scott Adams enhanced his adventures' visual appeal with colorful---albeit
static---images.
Oregon Trail also received graphic enhancements and became
a bestseller on the Apple~II and other computers;
the millions of
North American elementary school students who played the game in school
in the 1980s--1990s
may be unaware that it was originally text-only.
Automated Simulations published two turn-based simulation games about
space colonization,
% high-quality ``space opera'' games,
\emph{Starfleet Orion} and \emph{Invasion Orion}, that were not only
written in BASIC but could be modified by sophisticated users to
customize the gameplay---since BASIC programs were interpreted, the
companies had no choice but to provide the source code.

\w{Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure} [sic] was a 1980 turn-based adventure game
written in Apple II Integer BASIC
that made extensive (for the time) use of
graphics, using the Apple's ``high resolution'' mode ($280\times 192$, 6 colors)
to display overall maps showing the player's
avatar and major landscape features (Figure~\ref{fig:odyssey_hires}), and its
``low resolution'' mode ($40\times 40$, 15
colors) mode to display ???.

When Commodore was unable to find any customers for a video game chip it
had developed, they instead used it in a new computer called the VIC-20,
While its hardware was entry-level, the graphics were impressive
compared to its competitors, and at just \$300, it dropped the price of
an entry-level PC by more than half.
Bob Albrecht brought his informal and folksy writing style to the
introductory programming manual that came with the breakthrough
computer~\cite{commodore}.
Not only did the VIC-20 outsell all other computers when introduced in
1982 (over 1 million units), it also stimulated the sales of the
first under-\$100 modem, which came bundled with free trials of various
dialup services including CompuServe and in 1982 accounted for the
largest traffic on that network.  The first bulletin board systems
(BBSes)---analogous to dialup newsgroup servers in the Unix world---were
written in BASIC.

\begin{tangent}{The last person to outsmart Bill Gates}
Hard-driving Commodore chairman Tramiel claimed that the wording of the
original ``flat fee'' deal between Commodore and Microsoft allowed
Commodore to make minor tweaks to the original PET BASIC and include it
with every VIC-20 and Commodore 64, without further payments to
Microsoft.
Over 1~millions VIC-20s and ???~million Commodore~64s would be sold.
This infuriated Gates, and it resulted in a BASIC unable to exploit
these computers' advanced graphics, but it did allow VIC-20 and
Commodore~64 buyers to run the many BASIC programs that had been written
for the PET, especially educational software, making the computers an
easy sell into both homes and schools~\cite[p. 414]{commodore}.

\end{tangent}

According to Wikipedia, there are over 450 extant and extinct dialects
of BASIC.
For all the criticism of ``street BASIC,'' its user experience was quite
close to the ``appliance'' view that BASIC's creators originally
intended: when PC users turned on their computers, the first thing
they'd see was a BASIC interpreter prompt, allowing them to jump right
in and start programming.  And program they did:
the first PC games and the first PC telecommunications programs were
written in BASIC, 
magazines published program listings in it, and one of the world's
largest and most successful software companies got its start with
well-crafted BASIC interpreters.  Some would call that victory.
