\makequotation{Whether we're still programming in it or not, the spirit
  of BASIC lives on in all of us.}{Jeff Atwood, founder of
  StackExchange and author of Coding Horror blog~\cite{codinghorror_basic}}

With no economical mass storage (floppy disks) coming until 1980, and no
consumer-facing Internet until the 1990s, BASIC programs were
distributed by a far more prosaic medium: you had to type in the source
code from a printed listing.  Students traded source code listings, 
magazines published listings contributed by readers, and in 1972, David
Ahl, then working in the education department of Digital Equipment
Corporation, published a whole book of them---\emph{BASIC Computer
  Games}~\cite{basic_computer_games}. 

Ahl's book had a backstory too.
The mother of all ``type-in'' BASIC games traces its origins to
1971, when Mike Mayfield and some high school friends ``borrowed'' time
on an SDS Sigma~7 computer at UC~Irvine to write a game inspired by the
original \emph{Star Trek} TV series.  \emph{Star Trek} had just ended its 3-season run and
was very popular among computer hobbyists.
In the game, the player commands the USS~Enterprise and moves it around
a grid seeking and destroying Klingon warships.  The grid was rendered
as a set of ASCII text characters, and was redrawn after each turn, so
the game could be played on both printing terminals like the ASR-33 and
the CRT displays that were around the corner.

Mayfield later ported the game to Hewlett-Packard BASIC in exchange for
some time on an HP-2000C timesharing computer at a local HP sales
office.
The HP version was discovered by David Ahl in the education department
of  Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC), which had carved out a profitable niche selling
minicomputers to
universities and small businesses.  (DEC would very soon be overtaken by
microcomputers.)  In the share-alike mentality of the day, Ahl
immediately ported Star Trek to DEC's dialect of BASIC and shared it freely via the DEC
Education Newsletter, encouraging readers to submit their own games.

In 1978 Ahl launched \emph{Creative Computing}, one of the first
magazines focused on emerging microcomputers and featuring lots of
so-called ``type-in programs.''
Ahl ported his original collection of games (including an improved
\emph{Super Star Trek}) to Microsoft BASIC, which had emerged as the
\emph{de~facto} standard microcomputer BASIC, and published the
resulting collection as \emph{BASIC Computer
Games}~\cite{basic_computer_games}.
The book became a staple in high school computer labs and hobbyists'
homes, and was the first computer book to sell over a million copies.

Younger readers may be surprised to learn how many pioneering games
written in BASIC relied on line-at-a-time text output, but
surprisingly sophisticated games were created this way.
Scott Adams wrote his first interactive text adventure games in BASIC, and started
the first software company devoted exclusively to game publishing,
Adventure International.\footnote{The earliest interactive text adventure (you type
``Go North''; the computer types back something like ``You are next to a
running stream'') had been written by Will Crowther in FORTRAN.}
Adams even published a complete game called \emph{Pirate's Adventure} as
a type-in program in a special issue of BYTE devoted to adventure
games~\cite{byte80:adventure}; the article helpfully notes which parts
of the BASIC program would have to be changed to run on other
Microsoft-derived BASIC dialects.
\emph{Oregon Trail}, a turn-based simulation based on the US westward
migration, was written in 1971 by Don Rawitsch, a college senior who was
a teaching assistant for a US~history course, with the help of
fellow student teachers Bill Heinemann and Paul Dillenberger.


BASIC's role in the 1980s is analogous to JavaScript's role in the
1990s: its performance and relative isolation from the hardware limited
the kinds of programs you could write, but your programs could have a
huge audience.
That slowly began to change 
as falling hardware prices enabled PCs with crude graphics:
each PC had its own idiosyncratic way of programming graphics, so BASIC
programs that relied on
platform-specific features weren't portable.

Still, games were crucial to the success of BASIC on PCs as well.
Later versions of Star Trek displayed ships as graphic icons rather than
letters and symbols on a text grid.
Scott Adams enhanced his adventures' visual appeal with colorful---albeit
static---images.
Oregon Trail also received graphic enhancements and became
a bestseller on the Apple~II and other computers;
the millions of
North American elementary school students who played the game in school
in the 1980s--1990s
may be unaware that it was originally text-only.
Strategy game publisher
Automated Simulations published two turn-based simulation games about
space colonization,
% high-quality ``space opera'' games,
\emph{Starfleet Orion} and \emph{Invasion Orion}, that were not only
written in BASIC but could be modified by sophisticated users to
customize the gameplay: since BASIC programs were interpreted, the
companies had no choice but to provide the source code.

\w{Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure} [sic] was a 1980 turn-based adventure game
written in Apple II Integer BASIC
that made extensive (for its time) use of
graphics, using the Apple's ``high resolution'' mode ($280\times 192$, 6 colors)
to display overall maps showing the player's
avatar and major landscape/seascape features, and its
``low resolution'' mode ($40\times 40$, 15
colors) mode to display cave and dungeon interiors in some phases of game play.
Figure~\ref{fig:odyssey} shows some screen shots from the game.

\picfigure{figs/odyssey.png}{fig:odyssey}{\emph{Odyssey: The Compleat
    Apventure} was written in Wozniak's Integer BASIC and made extensive
  use of the Apple II's color graphics.  Each ``phase'' of the game was
  a completely separate program, loaded \w[Overlay (programming)]{overlay}-style.}

Meanwhile, Commodore, the company under whose umbrella MOS Technology
had produced the wildly popular 6502 microprocessor, had been working on
a video game chip they hoped to sell to home game console manufacturers
such as Atari.
When Commodore was unable to find any customers for the chip, two young
Commodore engineers, Bob Yannes and Al Charpentier, decided instead to
develop an inexpensive computer around it.
The VIC-20 had entry-level hardware but very impressive graphics
compared to its competitors, and at just \$300, it dropped the price
of an entry-level PC by more than half.
Bob Albrecht brought his informal and folksy writing style to the
introductory programming manual that came with the breakthrough
computer~\cite{commodore}.
Not only did the VIC-20 outsell all other computers when introduced in
1982 (over 1 million units), it also stimulated the sales of the first
under-\$100 modem, which came bundled with free trials of various dialup
services including CompuServe and in 1982 accounted for the largest
traffic on that network.
The first bulletin board systems (BBSes)---analogous to dialup
newsgroup servers in the Unix world---were written in BASIC.
A little over a year later, Commodore engineers outdid themselves with
the Commodore~64, the best-selling personal computer of all time (over
10 million sold), featuring spectacular graphics and sound and 64KiB
of RAM for an unheard-of \$595.

\begin{tangent}
Hard-driving Commodore chairman Tramiel may have been the last person to
outsmart Bill Gates.
Tramiel claimed that the wording of the original ``flat fee'' paid to
Microsoft for porting BASIC to the PET allowed Commodore to package
BASIC with every \emph{computer} sold, not just every \emph{PET} sold,
as long as no substantive changes (``derivative works'') were made.
Of course, this meant Commodore couldn't legally modify BASIC to allow
access to the advanced graphics and sound capabilities in the VIC-20 or
Commodore~64, so programmers had to learn bits of 6502 assembly language
to do anything more than rudimentary graphics.
But it allowed Commodore to sell over 1~million VIC-20s and over
10~million Commodore~64s without further payments to Microsoft.
This infuriated Bill Gates, and resulted in an arguably crippled BASIC
unable to exploit these computers' advanced graphics and sound.
But it did allow VIC-20 and Commodore~64 buyers to run many BASIC
programs that had been written for the PET, especially educational
software, making the computers an easy sell into both homes and
schools~\cite[p. 414]{commodore}.
\end{tangent}

BASIC also provided a new avenue of empowerment for young programmers.
Game designer Richard Garriott started writing games in BASIC at the age
of thirteen, and created his first game offered for sale,
\emph{Akalabeth,} when he was just eighteen.
While that game was perhaps primitive compared to some commercial
competitors written in faster assembly language, it was the first game
to provide a 3D first-person perspective view of the dungeon maze,
albeit a crude one~\cite{akalabeth}.
Garriott went on to become one of the most successful (and
wealthiest) computer game designers in the world; the first version of
his very successful \emph{Ultima} was also written in BASIC.
In principle, any parent could now buy a computer for their child and
sign a distribution agreement to allow the young prodigy's work to
find its market.

As of this writing (2016), cloud-based IDEs such as Codenvy and Cloud9
have come into their own: anyone can fire up a Web browser and
immediately start programming.
For all the criticism of ``street BASIC,'' its user experience was quite
close to this ``programmer appliance'' view, as BASIC's creators
originally intended: when PC users turned on their computers, the first
thing they'd see was a BASIC interpreter prompt, allowing them to jump
right in and start programming.
And program they did: the first PC games and the first PC
telecommunications programs were written in BASIC, magazines published
program listings in it, and one of the world's largest and most
successful software companies got its start with well-crafted BASIC
interpreters.
According to Wikipedia, there are today over 450 extant and extinct
dialects of BASIC.
Some would call that victory.
